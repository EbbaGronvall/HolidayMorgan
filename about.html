                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>We are four musicans who met whilst studying music in Stockholm, Sweden. We noticed quickly that we had the same goal with our music and that is to entertain people.

                <p>Maja is our singer and our glue. She holds the group together and makes sure everyone on and off stage is having a good time.
                    She may look intimidating with her tattoos but she is the sweetest and she will always make sure your needs are met.

                    He's also a total pro when it comes to setting up the stage and does this in no time.
