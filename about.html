          <h2>Who are we?</h2>
          <p>
            We are four musicans who met whilst studying music in Stockholm,
            Sweden. We noticed quickly that we had the same goal with our music
            and that is to entertain people.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="who-are-we">
          <h3>Maja Hobring</h3>
          <p>
            Maja is our singer and our glue. She holds the group together and
            makes sure everyone on and off stage is having a good time. She may
            look intimidating with her tattoos but she is the sweetest and she
            will always make sure your needs are met.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="who-are-we">
          <h3>Oscar Erixon</h3>
          <p>
            Oscar is our drummer and he is the engine of the group. He has a lot
            of energy that is contagious to everyone in his surroundings. He's
            also a total pro when it comes to setting up the stage and does this
            in no time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="who-are-we">
          <h3>Martin Norman</h3>
          <p>
            Martin is our guitarist that puts the glitter in the songs with his
            quick fingers on his precious guitar.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="who-are-we">
          <h3>Albin Signell</h3>
          <p>
            Albin is our bass player and the newest member of our little group.
            While he is slapping the strings on his bass he will also show you
            his amazing dancemoves.
